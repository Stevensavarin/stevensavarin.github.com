## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Eat Healthy up and running on your local machine.

### Requirements

  - A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).
  - Node.js (for `http-server`, though any static web server will work).

### Local Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stevensavarin/wdd330.git
    cd wdd330
    ```

    (Make sure `wdd330` is the correct name of your repository if it's different.)

2.  **Install a static web server** (if you don't have one):
    If you don't have `http-server` installed globally, you can do so via npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    From the project root directory (where `index.html` is located), start the server:

    ```bash
    http-server .
    ```

4.  **Open in your browser**:
    Open your browser and navigate to the address provided by `http-server` (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8080` or `http://localhost:8080`).

## üåê Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to work correctly when deployed to GitHub Pages as a project site (i.e., in a subdirectory like `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`).

The crucial configuration for path resolution is handled dynamically within the JavaScript, ensuring resources load correctly in both environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  - **HTML5**: Application structure.
  - **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design.
  - **JavaScript ES Modules (ESM)**: Core logic, client-side routing, and interactive functionalities.
